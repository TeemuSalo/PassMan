# PassMan
Password Manager for Android devices. A simple application requiring no device permissions from the user.
It is intended mainly as a very basic password manager. Also can be considered as my first practical android
application that I personally use daily.

Current features:
* Requires a user friendly digit password on startup to access other passwords
* Create folders to organize passwords into groups eg. Home, Work, Others
* Export passwords with one click from application internal memory into an SD card
* Import previously exported passwords into application, useful in case of updates

This Github version does not include a "crypting" function. It is simply a very naive character scramble using
bit shifting and static numbers as multipliers and dividers currently on implemented in my personal application.
Something I personally wanted to try out with java.
